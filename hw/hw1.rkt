; Section #: 1
; Student ID:

; We are going to make a class "quilt" of 200-pixels-wide, 200-pixels-high images,
; with each class member designing one of the 200-pixel-by-200-pixel images.
;
; After a blank line, write one or more expressions that meet the following requirements:
; - the final resulting image should be the result of at least THREE different image or image-
;   related operations from the 2htdp/image teachpack. (More is fine!)
; - the final resulting image should be an expression of type image that is precisely
;   200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high (use image-width and image-height to check)
