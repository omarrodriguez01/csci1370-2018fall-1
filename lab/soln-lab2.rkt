; Purpose: To practice designing functions using the design recipe.

; Due: by end of lab today. Submit whatever you have by the end of lab, even if incomplete.

; Refer to lab2-recipe-example.rkt for reference

; General instructions:
; - Follow the design recipe! The objective is to learn the steps
;
; - Do not write over any intermediate steps (stub and template),
;   instead, comment them out and leave them in your file
;   (refer to lab2-recipe-example.rkt to see what I mean)
;
; - For the Examples step, write at least 2 different check-expect expressions


; Part 1: Design a function named say-bye that expects
;   someone's name, and produces a string containing
;   "Goodbye, " followed by their name



; Part 2: Design a function named avg-trio that expects three numbers, 
;   and produces the average of those three numbers.




; SUBMISSION:
