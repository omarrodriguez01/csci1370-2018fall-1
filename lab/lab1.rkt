; Section #: 1
; Student ID 1:
; Student ID 2:

; Purpose: To start using the DrRacket Integrated Development Environment (IDE),
; and to practice writing Beginning Student Language (BSL) Racket simple and
; compound expressions of several data types within that environment.

; Due: by end of lab today. Submit whatever you have by the end of lab, even if incomplete.


; PART 1
; Under each comment below, write an expression that meets the comment's description

; Remember: simple expressions are literal values

; 1.1 simple expression of type number


; 1.2 simple expression of type string


; 1.3 simple expression of type boolean


; 1.4 simple expression of type image (hint: cute cats)


; Remember: compound expressions involve operations on other expressions

; 1.5 compound expression of type number


; 1.6 compound expression of type string


; 1.7 compound expression of type boolean


; 1.8 compound expression of type image


; PART 2

; The following are currently NOT "correct" Racket expressions --
; they do NOT follow Racket's syntax rules.

; Correct each (with a minimum of alteration) so that the result is
; an expression that DOES follow Racket's syntax rules, and type those
; corrected expressions in your Definitions window (each starting on its own line).
;
; (Note: sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to correct each of these!)

; 2.1 The number 13.13
; (13.13)

; 2.2 A solid green circle
; circle ("green" 55)

; 2.3 Should result in 93
; (+ (48) (/ 15 3)) (5 * 8)))


; PART 3

; Look over pages 1 and 2 of the handout, "Some DrRacket Tidbits"
; Choose at least three different image or image-related functions
; from this handout that you will try out. Then, after a blank line,
; write at least three compound expressions, each using at least one
; different image or image-related function from this handout.

; 3.1
; compound expression of type image 1

; 3.2
; compound expression of type image 2

; 3.3
; compound expression of type image 1


; PART 4

; Write a SINGLE compound expression in DrRacket that meets all of the following requirements:
; - It should result in an image.
; - It should use at least THREE different image or image-related operations from the 2htdp/image
;    module/teachpack. (More is fine!)
; â€“ They can be image operations from the "Some DrRacket Tidbits" handout, OR
;    they can be image operations (from the 2htdp/image teachpack) that you find by
;    exploring DrRacket's Help feature, described a bit at the end of
;    the "Some DrRacket Tidbits" handout.

; SUBMISSION: 
; - Save this file as lab1.rkt
; - EACH student in the pair should submit (the same file) to Blackboard: Exercises (in the left-hand sidebar) > Lab 1
