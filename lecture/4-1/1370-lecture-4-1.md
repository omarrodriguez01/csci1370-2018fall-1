### Adding complexity in 2 directions (and matching skill):

- Multiple parameters (identify data types from word problems)
- Multiple discrete steps to solve the problems (identify discrete steps)

---

### Multiple parameters

- 2-player Rock, paper, scissors
- Check if available for office hours based on day of the week and hour of the day
- Mixing primary colors
- Calculate insurance premium from gender, age, and number of tickets on record
