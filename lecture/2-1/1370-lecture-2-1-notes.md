Getting help in BSL


motivate functions
	calculate grades: minimum required to get an A, minimum required to get a C, how much of a grade: not quite a C
	
	calculation in BSL
	
	type it out: type the formula out three times
	
	what's the alternative?
	
	make a function, turn the scores into variables
	
	mention abstraction

function definition syntax
	- function definitions
	- vocabulary: function name, parameters, argument, body, function call, signature, header




statements vs expressions: side-effects vs values


what are misconceptions? common mistakes?
	- calling functions with the wrong capitalization
	- defining two functions with the same name
	- using same variable names in different functions


Your turn: 

- split the bill
- greeter
- how many pizzas
