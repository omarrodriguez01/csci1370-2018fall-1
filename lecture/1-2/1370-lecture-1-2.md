### What is the type of the expression: `"352"`

# A. number
# B. string
# C. boolean
# D. image
# E. syntax error

---

# What is the purpose of explicitly distinguishing between different types of data?

---

# Operations 
# (compound expressions)

---

#### Which of the below are valid expressions that represent addition in BSL?

# A. `(+ 3)`
# B. `(+ 3 2)`
# C. `(3 + 2)`
# D. `(+ 2 3 (+ 6 -34))`
## E. More than one of the above

---

# What is the syntax for the addition operation in BSL?

---

# Arguments
# Call / Invoke / Apply

---

#### Which of the following is a Racket compound expression whose value is the square root of 36? 

## A. (sqrt 36)

```
; number string string -> image
;
; purpose: expects a radius in pixels, either "solid" or
;    "outline", and a color written as a string, and
;    produces a circle image with that 
;    radius, style, and color

(circle 30 "solid" "red")
```

## With respect to providing arguments to `circle`, what are the ways we can do this incorrectly?

# More operations!

## A. number
## B. string
## C. boolean
## D. image
